        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="sticky-note">
            <p>My name is Tsheyang Tshogyal. I am from Mongar in the eastern side of Bhutan. I would call myself an
                introvert because I feel more comfortable in quiet places. I do not like big crowds and I enjoy spending
                time alone. Being alone helps me think, read, draw, or just relax. Over time, I have learned that being
                introverted is okay, and it even gives me time to think about things and explore my hobbies and
                interests.</p>

        <h2>My Childhood</h2>
        <div class="sticky-note">
            <p>When I was a child, I spent most of my time alone. I rarely played with other kids in my neighborhood. I
                liked drawing, painting, and doing activities by myself. I was born premature, so I had to go to
                Guwahati, India for health checkups often. Because of that, I spent a lot of time there and created many
                memories with my grandparents, especially my grandfather. Even though I am from Bhutan, part of my
                childhood was in Guwahati,India. I often went there for my health checkups and i basically grew up there. Guwahati is 
                by childhood home and a special place for me filled with memories.</p>

        <h2>My Primary School Life</h2>
        <div class="sticky-note">
            <p>I studied in a private school with fewer students, which was exactly what I liked. The smaller
                environment made it easier to make friends and get help from teachers. I spent six years at Phuensum
                Primary School and created many memories there. I joined different activities and learned a lot, not
                just from lessons but from being part of a school community. My teachers and friends at Phuensum gave me
                support, encouragement, and love, which helped me grow and enjoy learning.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
        <div class="sticky-note">
            <p>I enjoy calligraphy very much. My English teacher in primary school first taught me how to write in
                cursive, and she always encouraged me. That is how I started practicing calligraphy. It is fun and
                relaxing for me. When I do calligraphy, it reminds me of my school days and the happy memories I had. It
                is also a way to focus and improve patience, and I enjoy seeing the results of my work.</p>

        <div class="sticky-note">
            <p>My family has always been very supportive. They care for me and help me in many ways. They encourage me
                to follow my interests and support me when I face challenges. I also have great friends from primary
                school and high school who are very caring. They make life more fun and help me feel connected. My
                family and friends are very important to me and make me feel happy and safe.</p>
